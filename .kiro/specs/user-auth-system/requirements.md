# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing broker-specific authentication system into a flexible user authentication system with broker management capabilities. The system will allow users to register with simple credentials, login independently of broker credentials, and then manage multiple broker connections through a dedicated interface.

## Glossary

- **User_Auth_System**: The new authentication system that manages user accounts independently of broker credentials
- **Broker_Manager**: The component responsible for managing broker connections and credentials
- **Angel_Broker**: The Angel One trading platform integration
- **User_Session**: The authenticated user session maintained after successful login
- **Broker_Connection**: A linked trading account from a supported broker platform

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with simple credentials (username, email, password), so that I can create an account without needing broker credentials upfront.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the registration page, THE User_Auth_System SHALL display fields for username, email, and password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data, THE User_Auth_System SHALL create a new user account in the database
3. IF a username or email already exists, THEN THE User_Auth_System SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN registration is successful, THE User_Auth_System SHALL redirect the user to the login page with a success message
5. THE User_Auth_System SHALL validate that passwords meet minimum security requirements (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to login with my username/email and password, so that I can access the application without broker credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the login page, THE User_Auth_System SHALL display fields for username/email and password
2. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, THE User_Auth_System SHALL authenticate the user and create a User_Session
3. IF login credentials are invalid, THEN THE User_Auth_System SHALL display an error message without revealing which field is incorrect
4. WHEN login is successful, THE User_Auth_System SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. THE User_Auth_System SHALL maintain the User_Session until logout or expiration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to see an "Add Broker" option in my dashboard, so that I can connect my trading accounts after authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in, THE User_Auth_System SHALL display the dashboard with an "Add Broker" link or button
2. WHEN a user has no connected brokers, THE User_Auth_System SHALL prominently display the "Add Broker" option
3. WHEN a user clicks "Add Broker", THE User_Auth_System SHALL navigate to the broker selection page
4. THE User_Auth_System SHALL display the number of connected brokers in the dashboard
5. WHERE a user has connected brokers, THE User_Auth_System SHALL display a list of connected broker accounts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user wanting to connect a broker, I want to see available broker options starting with Angel One, so that I can choose which trading platform to connect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the broker selection page, THE Broker_Manager SHALL display available broker options
2. THE Broker_Manager SHALL prominently display Angel One as the primary supported broker
3. WHEN a user selects Angel One, THE Broker_Manager SHALL navigate to the Angel broker connection page
4. THE Broker_Manager SHALL indicate which brokers are "Coming Soon" for future expansion
5. WHERE multiple brokers are available, THE Broker_Manager SHALL allow users to connect multiple broker accounts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user connecting Angel One, I want to enter my Angel broker credentials (client ID, PIN, TOTP), so that I can link my Angel trading account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Angel connection page, THE Broker_Manager SHALL display fields for Angel client ID, PIN, TOTP, and API key
2. WHEN a user submits Angel credentials, THE Broker_Manager SHALL authenticate with the Angel One API
3. IF Angel authentication succeeds, THEN THE Broker_Manager SHALL store the broker connection and redirect to dashboard
4. IF Angel authentication fails, THEN THE Broker_Manager SHALL display the specific error message from Angel One API
5. THE Broker_Manager SHALL securely store Angel authentication tokens for the user session

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with connected brokers, I want to manage my broker connections, so that I can view, disconnect, or reconnect my trading accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their dashboard, THE Broker_Manager SHALL display all connected broker accounts with status
2. WHEN a user clicks on a connected broker, THE Broker_Manager SHALL show broker account details and options
3. WHERE a broker connection is active, THE Broker_Manager SHALL display "Connected" status with last sync time
4. WHEN a user chooses to disconnect a broker, THE Broker_Manager SHALL remove the broker connection after confirmation
5. IF a broker connection expires, THEN THE Broker_Manager SHALL display "Reconnect" option and handle re-authentication

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure session management, so that my account and broker connections remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Auth_System SHALL automatically log out users after 24 hours of inactivity
2. WHEN a user logs out, THE User_Auth_System SHALL clear all session data and broker tokens
3. THE User_Auth_System SHALL hash and salt all user passwords before database storage
4. THE User_Auth_System SHALL use secure session tokens that cannot be easily guessed or replicated
5. WHERE broker tokens expire, THE User_Auth_System SHALL handle re-authentication transparently when possible
