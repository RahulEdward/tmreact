# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the TradingMaven Flask application's frontend from server-side rendered templates to a modern React.js single-page application (SPA). The migration will maintain all existing functionality while providing a more responsive and modern user experience. The Flask backend will be converted to serve as a REST API, with all business logic and data processing remaining unchanged.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to access the same authentication system through a React interface, so that I can securely log into the platform with my existing credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the login page THEN the system SHALL display a React-based login form with fields for Client ID, PIN, and TOTP
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the existing Flask auth system and return a JWT token
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the JWT token securely in the browser and redirect to the dashboard
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view my trading dashboard with real-time data in a React interface, so that I can monitor my account status and trading metrics efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display account balance, collateral, unrealized PNL, realized PNL, and utilized margin in responsive cards
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch margin data from the Flask API and display it in real-time
3. WHEN margin data is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without requiring a page refresh
4. WHEN there are API errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages while maintaining the dashboard layout
5. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display the dashboard in a responsive layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view my order book through a React interface, so that I can track all my trading orders with real-time updates and filtering capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the order book THEN the system SHALL display a table with trading symbol, exchange, transaction type, quantity, price, trigger price, order type, product type, order ID, status, and timestamp
2. WHEN the order book loads THEN the system SHALL show statistics cards for buy orders, sell orders, completed orders, open orders, and rejected orders
3. WHEN new orders are placed THEN the system SHALL update the order book in real-time using WebSocket connections
4. WHEN orders have different statuses THEN the system SHALL color-code them appropriately (green for complete, red for rejected, orange for open)
5. WHEN there are no orders THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view my trade book, positions, and holdings through React interfaces, so that I can monitor my trading activity and portfolio performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the trade book THEN the system SHALL display all executed trades with relevant details in a responsive table
2. WHEN a user accesses positions THEN the system SHALL show current positions with symbol, exchange, product type, net quantity, and average price
3. WHEN a user accesses holdings THEN the system SHALL display portfolio holdings with statistics and performance metrics
4. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN there are API errors THEN the system SHALL display error messages while maintaining the page structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to access API key management, logs, search functionality, and TradingView integration through React interfaces, so that I can manage my account and trading tools effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses API key management THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces to view, generate, and manage API keys
2. WHEN a user accesses logs THEN the system SHALL display trading logs with filtering and search capabilities
3. WHEN a user accesses search functionality THEN the system SHALL provide token/symbol search with autocomplete
4. WHEN a user accesses TradingView integration THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing JSON-based integration functionality
5. WHEN users navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without full page reloads

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time notifications and updates in the React interface, so that I can stay informed about order executions and system events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orders are executed THEN the system SHALL display real-time notifications using WebSocket connections
2. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL play audio alerts and show visual notifications
3. WHEN notifications are displayed THEN the system SHALL allow users to dismiss them appropriately
4. WHEN multiple notifications occur THEN the system SHALL queue and display them in an organized manner
5. WHEN WebSocket connections are lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the React application to maintain the same visual design and branding, so that I have a consistent experience with the current platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React app loads THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme, typography, and branding as the current Flask templates
2. WHEN displaying components THEN the system SHALL maintain the same layout patterns and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN showing data tables THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the current design
4. WHEN displaying forms THEN the system SHALL maintain the same input styling and validation patterns
5. WHEN accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL provide the same responsive behavior as the current templates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flask backend to serve as a REST API, so that the React frontend can consume data efficiently while maintaining all existing business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React app makes API requests THEN the Flask backend SHALL respond with JSON data instead of rendered templates
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens for protected API endpoints
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing business logic and data processing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in JSON format
5. WHEN CORS is needed THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate CORS headers for the React frontend

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the React application to handle routing and navigation seamlessly, so that I can navigate between different sections efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to different routes THEN the system SHALL update the URL and display the appropriate React component
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain the current route and display the correct content
3. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate appropriately between visited pages
4. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the system SHALL check authentication status and redirect if necessary
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL update the active navigation state in the header

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the React application to maintain all existing functionality, so that I don't lose any features during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any feature THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the current Flask template version
2. WHEN performing trading operations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API integrations and data flow
3. WHEN accessing admin features THEN the system SHALL preserve all administrative capabilities
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide the same mobile experience as the current responsive templates
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate user feedback
