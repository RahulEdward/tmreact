## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Flask backend running on http://localhost:5000

### Installation

1. Navigate to the react-frontend directory:
```bash
cd react-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The React app will run on http://localhost:5173 and proxy API calls to the Flask backend.

### Available Scripts

## Configuration

### Proxy Configuration
The Vite development server is configured to proxy the following routes to Flask:
- `/api/*` - API endpoints
- `/auth/*` - Authentication routes
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard data
- `/orderbook` - Order book data
- `/tradebook` - Trade book data
- `/positions` - Positions data
- `/holdings` - Holdings data
- `/socket.io/*` - WebSocket connections

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for environment-specific configuration:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_WS_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Integration with Flask Backend

This React frontend is designed to work with the existing Flask backend without requiring any changes to the Flask application. It communicates with Flask through:

1. **HTTP API calls** - Using existing Flask routes
2. **WebSocket connections** - Connecting to existing SocketIO implementation
3. **Session management** - Working with Flask's session cookies

## Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS with a custom configuration that matches the existing Flask template design:
- Dark theme with mesh background
- Primary color: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Accent color: #10B981 (green)
- Inter font family

## Next Steps

Continue with Task 2 to implement authentication system and routing. Each task builds incrementally on the previous ones.
